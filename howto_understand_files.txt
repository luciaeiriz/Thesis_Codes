#Some notes about what is in each type of file that I send you.

###

#Lightcurves: these are the data files, calibrated with respect to a reference
#night(that has the number '0' for JD).
#For each night I have the coordinates, JD, magnitude, error.
#Not all the stars will have data in all filters or nights.

#The lightcurves are called e.g. CepOB3_FILTER_NPh_aperphot_ststar_v4_partXX_all_xcalibrated_clean.vot

#Where FILTER may be gSDSS, rSDSS, iSDSS, zSDSS, uJAVA, J0660,and each filter is divided in 4 #parts (mostly because python tends to crash when dealing with huge files).
#The parts correspond to the same location of the image, e.g. the first part of gSDSS, independently of its number, goes with the first part of rSDSS (e.g. the 01 and 13 are the same stars in different areas).

#examples:

CepOB3_uJAVA_NPh_aperphot_ststar_v4_part20_all_xcalibrated_clean.vot
CepOB3_J0660_NPh_aperphot_ststar_v4_part09_all_xcalibrated_clean.vot 
CepOB3_zSDSS_NPh_aperphot_ststar_v4_part21_all_xcalibrated_clean.vot

#Tools to calculate indices.
#These are done for the SA and Stetson indices, but you may want to construct
#similar tools for other indices.
#In general, I wrote the programs in a way that they can run on any number of nights, so if I get more data, I don't have to modify them.

do_SA04_NPh_CepOB3_v4_aperphot5pix_ref0_varia_indices.py
do_stetson_Mindex_per_lightcurve_CepOB3_v4_aperphot5pix_ref0.py

#There are some routines written separately, to extract lightcurves or do the actual index calculation, e.g.

do_stetson_aperphot.py # to calculate stetson index
do_mindex_aperphot.py #for the M-index
do_lightcurve_aperphot.py #to extract ligthcurve data



#I also created a tool to plot a lightcurve of an individual source, it may be good to have a look at what the data look like.
#You need to give the coordinates of the source you want to check as well as the limits for the plot. I normally run from ipython using system arguments.

plot_lightcurve_by_coords.py

#It needs the coordinates and offsets as arguments to run, e.g. in the ipython terminal

#Some results of indices that I have already calculated.
#I am including the indices I calculated using the above programs, to show what they are and to let you explore what you could do with them.

#There is one SA04 index file per filter and part, e.g.
CepOB3_gSDSS_NPh_aperphot_ststar_v4_part03_NPh_ref0_ststar_v4_sa04_NPh_v4_indices.vot


#In these files, what you have is the coordinates for each star, the number of observations available (although I am thinking that one is not counting properly and it only shows the total) and the final indices.

#For the Stetson and M-indices, because they combine indices, there is one file per part (based on the part numbering from gSDSS)
CepOB3_part1_NPh_aperphot_ref0_v1_catalogids_stetson_Mindex_ststar_5px.vot
etc

#These contain a lot more info per star, including nr of observations in each filter, average mag and std (this could be also useful for calculating other indices), 2sets of combinations of Stetson indices (all possible combinations except for uJAVA, that has poorer data), and the M indices per filter.
#The 2 versions of stetson are per individual filter _ind or per night (no subscript). It seems the per night have a better estimate of the uncertainty so they are probably better, but it may be worth checking that as well.

#IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The lightcurves are not absolutely-calibrated, they are given relative to the reference night. Thus a colour-mag diagram will not work.
- The files are quite large. If you are plotting a lightcurve, it reads **all** the tables. It can take a few minutes. If you rather save time, you may want to create a second program, once all your tables are read in ipython, so any other star is just ran without reading them all again.
- It would be a good idea to create any programs as file-format-independent as possible. E.g. if we add more observations (which we will most likely do by the end of the year), that you can just run the same program without having to edit it to account for the changes.



#Data:
- Each data is in the form 'CepOB3_*x*_NPh_aperphot_ststar_v4_part*0y*_all_xcalibrated_clean.vot':
    where *x* can be any of the following: gSDSS, rSDSS, iSDSS, zSDSS, J0660, uJAVA, each corresponding to a different filter
    *y* can be any number from 1-4, the area of sky being observed is too big so it is divided into four parts, part 1 of one filter and part 1 of another filter corresponds to the same region in the sky
- Theres also data in the form of 'CepOB3_*x*_NPh_aperphot_ststar_v4_part*0y*_NPh_ref0_ststar_v4_sa04_NPh_v4_indices.vot'
    This containes the RA and DEC for the star alongside the corresponding number of observations and the variability index for the SA04 index
- For those named 'CepOB3_part1_NPh_aperphot_ref0_v1_catalogids_stetson_Mindex_ststar_5px.vot' etc
    For the Stetson and M-indices, because they combine indices, there is one file per part (based on the part numbering from gSDSS)

#plot_lightcurve_by_coords.py:
- Plots a lightcurve for a specified star
    The code requires 4 arguments to run: RA DEC offset1 offset2
    RA and DEC can be copied from the 'xcalibrated_clean.vot' files
    Offset 1 (can be changed)
    This geneates a plot for the specified star (given by RA and DEC) and shows the variability for all filters

#do_lightcurve_aperphot.py:
- Extracts the lightcurve data
